So far, the game is only an experimental tech demo to mess around with dynamic AI behaviors and reactions.
The AI use a state deisgn pattern, as well has goal action planning to decide on their targets. 
Features:
dropable and breakable items
Play spawn and control
Editable AI behaviors 


Origional single player plan:
An RPG where you play as a "Molat", trying to survive in the Molat tunnels.
You will find yourself fending off enemies, making allies, and finding ways to escape the deadly spiders.
Work with dyanmic AI to fend off other clans, but be careful not to stand out, or the others may cast you aside and leave you to die.
